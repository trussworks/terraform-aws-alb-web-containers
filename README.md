Creates an ALB for serving an HTTPS web app.

Creates the following resources:

* ALB with HTTP (redirect) and HTTPS listeners.
* Target group for the HTTPS listener.
* Security Groups for the ALB.

The HTTP listener redirects to HTTPS.

The HTTPS listener uses a certificate stored in ACM or IAM.

## Terraform Versions

Terraform 0.11. Pin module version to ~> 2.6.1. Submit pull-requests to terraform011 branch.

## Usage

```hcl
module "app_alb" {
  source = "trussworks/alb-web-containers/aws"

  name           = "app"
  environment    = "prod"
  logs_s3_bucket = "my-aws-logs"

  alb_vpc_id                  = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  alb_subnet_ids              = "${module.vpc.public_subnets}"
  alb_default_certificate_arn = "${aws_acm_certificate.cert.arn}"

  container_port    = "443"
  health_check_path = "/health"
}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| alb\_certificate\_arns | The ARNs of the certificates to be attached to the ALB. | list | `[]` | no |
| alb\_default\_certificate\_arn | The ARN of the default certificate to be attached to the ALB. | string | n/a | yes |
| alb\_internal | If true, the ALB will be internal. Default's to false, the ALB will be public. | string | `"false"` | no |
| alb\_ssl\_policy | The SSL policy (aka security policy) for the Application Load Balancer that specifies the TLS protocols and ciphers allowed.  See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies>. | string | `"ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08"` | no |
| alb\_subnet\_ids | Subnet IDs for the ALB. Use public subnets for a public ALB and private subnets for an internal ALB. | list | n/a | yes |
| alb\_vpc\_id | VPC ID to be used by the ALB. | string | n/a | yes |
| allow\_public\_http | Allow inbound access from the Internet to port 80 | string | `"true"` | no |
| allow\_public\_https | Allow inbound access from the Internet to port 443 | string | `"true"` | no |
| container\_port | The port on which the container will receive traffic. | string | `"443"` | no |
| container\_protocol | The protocol to use to connect with the container. | string | `"HTTPS"` | no |
| deregistration\_delay | The amount time for the LB to wait before changing the state of a deregistering target from draining to unused. Default is 90s. | string | `"90"` | no |
| environment | Environment tag, e.g prod. | string | n/a | yes |
| health\_check\_interval | The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an individual target. Minimum value 5 seconds, Maximum value 300 seconds. Default 30 seconds. | string | `"30"` | no |
| health\_check\_path | The destination for the health check requests to the container. | string | `"/"` | no |
| health\_check\_success\_codes | The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from the container. You can specify multiple values (for example, '200,202') or a range of values (for example, '200-299'). | string | `"200"` | no |
| health\_check\_timeout | The health check timeout. Minimum value 2 seconds, Maximum value 60 seconds. Default 5 seconds. | string | `"5"` | no |
| healthy\_threshold | The number of consecutive health checks successes required before considering an unhealthy target healthy. Defaults to 3. | string | `"3"` | no |
| logs\_s3\_bucket | S3 bucket for storing Application Load Balancer logs. | string | n/a | yes |
| name | The service name. | string | n/a | yes |
| target\_group\_name | Override the default name of the ALB's target group. Must be less than or equal to 32 characters. Default: ecs-[name]-[environment]-[protocol]. | string | `""` | no |
| unhealthy\_threshold | The number of consecutive health check failures required before considering the target unhealthy. For Network Load Balancers, this value must be the same as the healthy_threshold. Defaults to 3. | string | `"3"` | no |
